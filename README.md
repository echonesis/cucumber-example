# Cucumber-versioned Specifications

## TODOs

- Construct Gherkin files, which are formatted as `*.feature`
  > I've created some sample files, such as `case_browsing.feature`, `case_scanning.feature` and `case_typing.feature`. You can try to modify those files to fit the real specifications.
- Write related definitions

## Usages

If you're not familiar with Cucumber.js, you can refer to `Makefile`.

```
# Environment Construction
make envc

# Test Sample
make test
```

Otherwise, you could modify `Makefile` or do other modifications on your own.
